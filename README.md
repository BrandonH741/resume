# Hello!

Hi to all of you who have found my GitHub page!

This is my main repository where I will showcase some of my projects. Being a frist year Computer Science student, I haven't done anything too fancy yet, but with my passion for problem solving and software design I know I can grow this with great things as time goes by!

I am currently looking for interships related to Software Engineering in the greater Seattle, San Jose, Denver, or Phoenix areas. Please check out my LinkedIn profile for more information about me, my education, and my work experience: www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-j-huyck

Being a first year student, I haven't taken many CS classes yet, but I have taken Computational Problem Solving in Data Science (our CS 101 class) and Data Structures (where I am learning about, you guessed it, Data Structures). Notably, I've recently learned about arrays, linked lists, and stacks; also, big-oh notation of performance analysis. Coming up this semester I will learn about queues, deques, binary trees, hash tables, and more!

Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you like what you find!
Brandon
